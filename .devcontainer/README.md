# Shikikit DevContainers

## Overview

Shikikit project supports DevContainers, making it easier for developers to set up and work on the project with a consistent development environment. DevContainers provide a pre-configured development environment that can be used for tasks like coding, debugging, and testing within a containerized environment.

## Purpose

The purpose of integrating DevContainers into Shikikit is to streamline the development setup process, ensuring that all developers have a consistent environment with the necessary tools and dependencies required to work on the project. This helps reduce setup time and minimizes potential issues related to varying development environments.

## Installation and Usage

To use Shikikit DevContainers, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites:
   * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Clone the Shikikit Repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/iwdt/shikikit.git
   ```
1. Open the Project in Visual Studio Code:
   * Open Visual Studio Code.
